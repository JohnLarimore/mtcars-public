# mtcars-public

A website mockup using the well known R dataset mtcars, using Shiny and ggplot2. 

This mockup will be used to validate a public facing website as a learning excercise in translating R to PHP. 

Most installations of R will be able to run this simple script right out of the box, as it only uses the packages Shiny and ggplot2, which are among the most popular R packages in existence. 

Shiny allows the creation of websites using R code (with custom functions for HTML tags) while ggplot2 is a graphing package based on the Grammar of Graphics. The public facing website will use the JavaScript D3 package, which is based on the same graphical principles.
